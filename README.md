![Mockup](md_images/mockup.png)

Welcome to PWR DUBLIN! A website designed for a fictional training facility in Dublin 15, encompassing the needs of powerlifters, bodybuilders and fighters all in one place. 

This website is tailored to both experineced athletes and fitness newbies looking to train and learn in a supporting and friendly environment. 
The site will be a hub for easily-accessible informative reading and critical information for potential clients. 

My goal is to achieve a professional-standard website using just HTML and CSS with room for further functionality in the future.
