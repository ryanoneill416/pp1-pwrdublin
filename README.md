![Responsiveness](./assets/screenshots/pwr-resp.jpg)

Welcome to PWR DUBLIN! A website designed for a fictional training facility in Dublin 15, encompassing the needs of powerlifters, bodybuilders and fighters all in one place. 

This website is tailored to both experineced athletes and fitness newbies looking to train and learn in a supporting and friendly environment. 

The site will be a hub for easily-accessible informative reading and critical information for potential clients. 

My goal is to achieve a professional-standard website using just HTML and CSS with room for further functionality in the future.

# Testing

## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome dev tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.
 This was used to identify issues with responsiveness as the screen sizes were adjusted in all possible scenarios.


## Compatibility testing

PWR Dublin was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices using Safari, Chrome and Firefox.
* The following devices were used to test compatibility in person:
    * 13" Macbook Pro.
    * Lenovo ThinkPad.
    * Chromebook.
    * iPad Air.
    * iPhone 13. 
    * Samasung Galaxy s7.
    * iPhone 4s.
* Chrome developer tools was used in conjunction with this to test how the site would perform on devices such as the Galaxy Fold and even the Google Nest devices.

## Bugs Encountered During Development


## Using percentages as the height of elements:

This was the first issue I encountered during the development stage. It resulted in elements being unreadable and looking extremely unappealing on different devices due to the individual screen heights.

I solved the issue by giving the elements fixed heights using pixels instead.

## Logo underline appearance:

In the early stages of the project I was having a problem giving the logo a visually appealing underline. The issue arised because of how the default underline property wasn't positioned below the text.

I solved this issue by digging and learning about the text-underline-offset property.

![Underline Bug](./assets/screenshots/pwr-logo-bug.jpg)

## Font awesome icon compatibility:

I discovered a problem with using the newest release of font awesome icons. The issue was that the version 6 of the icons was not being recognised by the browser and would result in a broken icon image.

To resolve this issue I reverted back to and used the previous version of the same font awesome icons.

## Use of fixed margins on devices with small screen width:

I was using margin values for the left and right of cards by using pixels however as the responsive was tested I realised that on small device widths this had resulted in the noticeable and unappealing narrowing of elements.

To solve this issue I introduced percentage values for the problematic margins in the media queries to compliment the appearance of the website on smaller devices.

## Horizontal scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen:

Upon noticing that the page had an unnecessary horizontal scrollbar, I sought to rectify this immediately.

To fix this I included the overflow-x style rule in the body tag as none of the elemnts on the website exceeded 100% of the screens width. 

![Horizontal Scrollbar Bug](./assets/screenshots/pwr-scrollbar-bug.jpg)

## Landing page appearance on devices with uncommon screen dimensions:

While testing responsiveness on numerous devices I found the site's appearance on devices of small screen height was not up to scratch. 

To fix this I added media queries to target the header appearance on such devices like the Nest Hub/ Nest Hub Max etc.

![Header Responsivity Bug](./assets/screenshots/pwr-header-bug.jpg)

## Performance testing

I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to perform checks on the performance of the site
Some things I had to adjust performance-wise were as follows:
* Compress images used multiple times to reduce loading times.
* Convert images to .webp to significantly reduce file size.
* Use alternative version of header background image for smaller device sizes to be more efficient in processing.

See the lighthouse performance scores below:

![performance_final](./assets/screenshots/pwr-lighthouse.jpg)

## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
